<P>cc65 generated programs with the default setup run with the kernal and basic
banked out. This gives a usable memory range of $1000 - $FD00.
Having the kernal and basic ROMs banked out means, that no ROM entry points
may be called directly from user code.</P>
<P>Special locations:</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Text screen</B><DD>
<P>The text screen is located at $C00 (as in the standard setup).</P>

<DT><B>Color RAM</B><DD>
<P>The color RAM is located at $800 (standard location).</P>

<DT><B>Stack</B><DD>
<P>The C runtime stack is located at $FCFF and growing downwards.</P>

<DT><B>Heap</B><DD>
<P>The C heap is located at the end of the program and grows towards the C
runtime stack.</P>
