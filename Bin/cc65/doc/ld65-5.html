<P>Configuration files are used to describe the layout of the output file(s). Two
major topics are covered in a config file: The memory layout of the target
architecture, and the assignment of segments to memory areas. In addition,
several other attributes may be specified.</P>
<P>Case is ignored for keywords, that is, section or attribute names, but it is
<EM>not</EM> ignored for names and strings.</P>



<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1</A> <A HREF="ld65.html#toc5.1">Memory areas</A>
</H2>


<P>Memory areas are specified in a <CODE>MEMORY</CODE> section. Lets have a look at an
example (this one describes the usable memory layout of the C64):</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        MEMORY {
            RAM1:  start = $0800, size = $9800;
            ROM1:  start = $A000, size = $2000;
            RAM2:  start = $C000, size = $1000;
            ROM2:  start = $E000, size = $2000;
        }
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>As you can see, there are two ram areas and two rom areas. The names
(before the colon) are arbitrary names that must start with a letter, with
the remaining characters being letters or digits. The names of the memory
areas are used when assigning segments. As mentioned above, case is
significant for these names.</P>
<P>The syntax above is used in all sections of the config file. The name
(<CODE>ROM1</CODE> etc.) is said to be an identifier, the remaining tokens up to the
semicolon specify attributes for this identifier. You may use the equal sign
to assign values to attributes, and you may use a comma to separate
attributes, you may also leave both out. But you <EM>must</EM> use a semicolon to
mark the end of the attributes for one identifier. The section above may also
have looked like this:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        # Start of memory section
        MEMORY
        {
            RAM1:
                start $0800
                size $9800;
            ROM1:
                start $A000
                size $2000;
            RAM2:
                start $C000
                size $1000;
            ROM2:
                start $E000
                size $2000;
        }
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>There are of course more attributes for a memory section than just start and
size. Start and size are mandatory attributes, that means, each memory area
defined <EM>must</EM> have these attributes given (the linker will check that). I
will cover other attributes later. As you may have noticed, I've used a
comment in the example above. Comments start with a hash mark (`#'), the
remainder of the line is ignored if this character is found.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2</A> <A HREF="ld65.html#toc5.2">Segments</A>
</H2>


<P>Let's assume you have written a program for your trusty old C64, and you would
like to run it. For testing purposes, it should run in the <CODE>RAM</CODE> area. So
we will start to assign segments to memory sections in the <CODE>SEGMENTS</CODE>
section:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        SEGMENTS {
            CODE:   load = RAM1, type = ro;
            RODATA: load = RAM1, type = ro;
            DATA:   load = RAM1, type = rw;
            BSS:    load = RAM1, type = bss, define = yes;
        }
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>What we are doing here is telling the linker, that all segments go into the
<CODE>RAM1</CODE> memory area in the order specified in the <CODE>SEGMENTS</CODE> section. So
the linker will first write the <CODE>CODE</CODE> segment, then the <CODE>RODATA</CODE>
segment, then the <CODE>DATA</CODE> segment - but it will not write the <CODE>BSS</CODE>
segment. Why? Enter the segment type: For each segment specified, you may also
specify a segment attribute. There are four possible segment attributes:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        ro      means readonly
        rw      means read/write
        bss     means that this is an uninitialized segment
        zp      a zeropage segment
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>So, because we specified that the segment with the name BSS is of type bss,
the linker knows that this is uninitialized data, and will not write it to an
output file. This is an important point: For the assembler, the <CODE>BSS</CODE>
segment has no special meaning. You specify, which segments have the bss
attribute when linking. This approach is much more flexible than having one
fixed bss segment, and is a result of the design decision to supporting an
arbitrary segment count.</P>
<P>If you specify "<CODE>type = bss</CODE>" for a segment, the linker will make sure that
this segment does only contain uninitialized data (that is, zeroes), and issue
a warning if this is not the case.</P>
<P>For a <CODE>bss</CODE> type segment to be useful, it must be cleared somehow by your
program (this happens usually in the startup code - for example the startup
code for cc65 generated programs takes care about that). But how does your
code know, where the segment starts, and how big it is? The linker is able to
give that information, but you must request it. This is, what we're doing with
the "<CODE>define = yes</CODE>" attribute in the <CODE>BSS</CODE> definitions. For each
segment, where this attribute is true, the linker will export three symbols.</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        __NAME_LOAD__   This is set to the address where the
                        segment is loaded.
        __NAME_RUN__    This is set to the run address of the
                        segment. We will cover run addresses
                        later.
        __NAME_SIZE__   This is set to the segment size.
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Replace <CODE>NAME</CODE> by the name of the segment, in the example above, this would
be <CODE>BSS</CODE>. These symbols may be accessed by your code.</P>
<P>Now, as we've configured the linker to write the first three segments and
create symbols for the last one, there's only one question left: Where does
the linker put the data? It would be very convenient to have the data in a
file, wouldn't it?</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3</A> <A HREF="ld65.html#toc5.3">Output files</A>
</H2>


<P>We don't have any files specified above, and indeed, this is not needed in a
simple configuration like the one above. There is an additional attribute
"file" that may be specified for a memory area, that gives a file name to
write the area data into. If there is no file name given, the linker will
assign the default file name. This is "a.out" or the one given with the
<CODE>
<A HREF="ld65-2.html#option-o">-o</A></CODE> option on the command line. Since the
default behaviour is ok for our purposes, I did not use the attribute in the
example above. Let's have a look at it now.</P>
<P>The "file" attribute (the keyword may also be written as "FILE" if you like
that better) takes a string enclosed in double quotes (`"') that specifies the
file, where the data is written. You may specify the same file several times,
in that case the data for all memory areas having this file name is written
into this file, in the order of the memory areas defined in the <CODE>MEMORY</CODE>
section. Let's specify some file names in the <CODE>MEMORY</CODE> section used above:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        MEMORY {
            RAM1:  start = $0800, size = $9800, file = %O;
            ROM1:  start = $A000, size = $2000, file = "rom1.bin";
            RAM2:  start = $C000, size = $1000, file = %O;
            ROM2:  start = $E000, size = $2000, file = "rom2.bin";
        }
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>The <CODE>%O</CODE> used here is a way to specify the default behaviour explicitly:
<CODE>%O</CODE> is replaced by a string (including the quotes) that contains the
default output name, that is, "a.out" or the name specified with the <CODE>
<A HREF="ld65-2.html#option-o">-o</A></CODE> option on the command line. Into this file, the
linker will first write any segments that go into <CODE>RAM1</CODE>, and will append
then the segments for <CODE>RAM2</CODE>, because the memory areas are given in this
order. So, for the RAM areas, nothing has really changed.</P>
<P>We've not used the ROM areas, but we will do that below, so we give the file
names here. Segments that go into <CODE>ROM1</CODE> will be written to a file named
"rom1.bin", and segments that go into <CODE>ROM2</CODE> will be written to a file
named "rom2.bin". The name given on the command line is ignored in both cases.</P>
<P>Assigning an empty file name for a memory area will discard the data written
to it. This is useful, if the a memory area has segments assigned that are
empty (for example because they are of type bss). In that case, the linker
will create an empty output file. This may be suppressed by assigning an empty
file name to that memory area.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss5.4">5.4</A> <A HREF="ld65.html#toc5.4">LOAD and RUN addresses (ROMable code)</A>
</H2>


<P>Let us look now at a more complex example. Say, you've successfully tested
your new "Super Operating System" (SOS for short) for the C64, and you
will now go and replace the ROMs by your own code. When doing that, you
face a new problem: If the code runs in RAM, we need not to care about
read/write data. But now, if the code is in ROM, we must care about it.
Remember the default segments (you may of course specify your own):</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        CODE            read only code
        RODATA          read only data
        DATA            read/write data
        BSS             uninitialized data, read/write
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Since <CODE>BSS</CODE> is not initialized, we must not care about it now, but what
about <CODE>DATA</CODE>? <CODE>DATA</CODE> contains initialized data, that is, data that was
explicitly assigned a value. And your program will rely on these values on
startup. Since there's no other way to remember the contents of the data
segment, than storing it into one of the ROMs, we have to put it there. But
unfortunately, ROM is not writable, so we have to copy it into RAM before
running the actual code.</P>
<P>The linker cannot help you copying the data from ROM into RAM (this must be
done by the startup code of your program), but it has some features that will
help you in this process.</P>
<P>First, you may not only specify a "<CODE>load</CODE>" attribute for a segment, but
also a "<CODE>run</CODE>" attribute. The "<CODE>load</CODE>" attribute is mandatory, and, if
you don't specify a "<CODE>run</CODE>" attribute, the linker assumes that load area
and run area are the same. We will use this feature for our data area:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        SEGMENTS {
            CODE:   load = ROM1, type = ro;
            RODATA: load = ROM2, type = ro;
            DATA:   load = ROM2, run = RAM2, type = rw, define = yes;
            BSS:    load = RAM2, type = bss, define = yes;
        }
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Let's have a closer look at this <CODE>SEGMENTS</CODE> section. We specify that the
<CODE>CODE</CODE> segment goes into <CODE>ROM1</CODE> (the one at $A000). The readonly data
goes into <CODE>ROM2</CODE>. Read/write data will be loaded into <CODE>ROM2</CODE> but is run
in <CODE>RAM2</CODE>. That means that all references to labels in the <CODE>DATA</CODE>
segment are relocated to be in <CODE>RAM2</CODE>, but the segment is written to
<CODE>ROM2</CODE>. All your startup code has to do is, to copy the data from it's
location in <CODE>ROM2</CODE> to the final location in <CODE>RAM2</CODE>.</P>
<P>So, how do you know, where the data is located? This is the second point,
where you get help from the linker. Remember the "<CODE>define</CODE>" attribute?
Since we have set this attribute to true, the linker will define three
external symbols for the data segment that may be accessed from your code:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        __DATA_LOAD__   This is set to the address where the segment
                        is loaded, in this case, it is an address in
                        ROM2.
        __DATA_RUN__    This is set to the run address of the segment,
                        in this case, it is an address in RAM2.
        __DATA_SIZE__   This is set to the segment size.
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>So, what your startup code must do, is to copy <CODE>__DATA_SIZE__</CODE> bytes from
<CODE>__DATA_LOAD__</CODE> to <CODE>__DATA_RUN__</CODE> before any other routines are called.
All references to labels in the <CODE>DATA</CODE> segment are relocated to <CODE>RAM2</CODE>
by the linker, so things will work properly.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss5.5">5.5</A> <A HREF="ld65.html#toc5.5">Other MEMORY area attributes</A>
</H2>


<P>There are some other attributes not covered above. Before starting the
reference section, I will discuss the remaining things here.</P>
<P>You may request symbols definitions also for memory areas. This may be
useful for things like a software stack, or an i/o area.</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        MEMORY {
            STACK:  start = $C000, size = $1000, define = yes;
        }
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>This will define three external symbols that may be used in your code:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        __STACK_START__         This is set to the start of the memory
                                area, $C000 in this example.
        __STACK_SIZE__          The size of the area, here $1000.
        __STACK_LAST__          This is NOT the same as START+SIZE.
                                Instead, it it defined as the first
                                address that is not used by data. If we
                                don't define any segments for this area,
                                the value will be the same as START.
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>A memory section may also have a type. Valid types are</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        ro      for readonly memory
        rw      for read/write memory.
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>The linker will assure, that no segment marked as read/write or bss is put
into a memory area that is marked as readonly.</P>
<P>Unused memory in a memory area may be filled. Use the "<CODE>fill = yes</CODE>"
attribute to request this. The default value to fill unused space is zero. If
you don't like this, you may specify a byte value that is used to fill these
areas with the "<CODE>fillval</CODE>" attribute. This value is also used to fill unfilled
areas generated by the assemblers <CODE>.ALIGN</CODE> and <CODE>.RES</CODE> directives.</P>
<P>The symbol <CODE>%S</CODE> may be used to access the default start address (that is,
the one defined in the 
<A HREF="#FEATURES">FEATURES</A> section, or the
value given on the command line with the <CODE>
<A HREF="ld65-2.html#option-S">-S</A></CODE>
option).</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss5.6">5.6</A> <A HREF="ld65.html#toc5.6">Other SEGMENT attributes</A>
</H2>


<P>Segments may be aligned to some memory boundary. Specify "<CODE>align = num</CODE>" to
request this feature. Num must be a power of two. To align all segments on a
page boundary, use</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        SEGMENTS {
            CODE:   load = ROM1, type = ro, align = $100;
            RODATA: load = ROM2, type = ro, align = $100;
            DATA:   load = ROM2, run = RAM2, type = rw, define = yes,
                    align = $100;
            BSS:    load = RAM2, type = bss, define = yes, align = $100;
        }
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>If an alignment is requested, the linker will add enough space to the output
file, so that the new segment starts at an address that is dividable by the
given number without a remainder. All addresses are adjusted accordingly. To
fill the unused space, bytes of zero are used, or, if the memory area has a
"<CODE>fillval</CODE>" attribute, that value. Alignment is always needed, if you have
used the <CODE>.ALIGN</CODE> command in the assembler. The alignment of a segment
must be equal or greater than the alignment used in the <CODE>.ALIGN</CODE> command.
The linker will check that, and issue a warning, if the alignment of a segment
is lower than the alignment requested in an <CODE>.ALIGN</CODE> command of one of the
modules making up this segment.</P>
<P>For a given segment you may also specify a fixed offset into a memory area or
a fixed start address. Use this if you want the code to run at a specific
address (a prominent case is the interrupt vector table which must go at
address $FFFA). Only one of <CODE>ALIGN</CODE> or <CODE>OFFSET</CODE> or <CODE>START</CODE> may be
specified. If the directive creates empty space, it will be filled with zero,
of with the value specified with the "<CODE>fillval</CODE>" attribute if one is given.
The linker will warn you if it is not possible to put the code at the
specified offset (this may happen if other segments in this area are too
large). Here's an example:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        SEGMENTS {
            VECTORS: load = ROM2, type = ro, start = $FFFA;
        }
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>or (for the segment definitions from above)</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        SEGMENTS {
            VECTORS: load = ROM2, type = ro, offset = $1FFA;
        }
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>The "<CODE>align</CODE>", "<CODE>start</CODE>" and "<CODE>offset</CODE>" attributes change placement
of the segment in the run memory area, because this is what is usually
desired. If load and run memory areas are equal (which is the case if only the
load memory area has been specified), the attributes will also work. There is
also an "<CODE>align_load</CODE>" attribute that may be used to align the start of the
segment in the load memory area, in case different load and run areas have
been specified. There are no special attributes to set start or offset for
just the load memory area.</P>
<P>To suppress the warning, the linker issues if it encounters a segment that is
not found in any of the input files, use "<CODE>optional=yes</CODE>" as additional
segment attribute. Be careful when using this attribute, because a missing
segment may be a sign of a problem, and if you're suppressing the warning,
there is no one left to tell you about it.</P>

<CODE>decreasing</CODE> as an argument. Specifies the sorting order of the entries
within the table. The default is <CODE>increasing</CODE>, which means that the
entries are sorted with increasing priority (the first entry has the lowest
priority). "Priority" is the priority specified when declaring a symbol as
<CODE>.CONDES</CODE> with the assembler, higher values mean higher priority. You may
change this behaviour by specifying <CODE>decreasing</CODE> as the argument, the
order of entries is reversed in this case.</P>
<P>Please note that the order of entries with equal priority is undefined.</P>

</DL>
</P>
<P>Without specifying the <CODE>CONDES</CODE> feature, the linker will not create any
tables, even if there are <CODE>condes</CODE> entries in the object files.</P>
<P>For more information see the <CODE>.CONDES</CODE> command in the 
<A HREF="ca65.html">ca65 manual</A>.</P>


<H3>The STARTADDRESS feature</H3>


<P><CODE>STARTADDRESS</CODE> is used to set the default value for the start address,
which can be referenced by the <CODE>%S</CODE> symbol. The builtin default for the
linker is $200.</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        FEATURES {
            # Default start address is $1000
            STARTADDRESS:       default = $1000;
        }
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Please note that order is important: The default start address must be defined
<EM>before</EM> the <CODE>%S</CODE> symbol is used in the config file. This does usually
mean, that the <CODE>FEATURES</CODE> section has to go to the top of the config file.</P>



<H2><A NAME="SYMBOLS"></A> <A NAME="ss5.10">5.10</A> <A HREF="ld65.html#toc5.10">The SYMBOLS section</A>
</H2>


<P>The configuration file may also be used to define symbols used in the link
stage. The mandatory attribute for a symbol is its value. A second, boolean
attribute named <CODE>weak</CODE> is available. If a symbol is marked as weak, it may
be overridden by defining a symbol of the same name from the command line. The
default for symbols is that they're strong, which means that an attempt to
define a symbol with the same name from the command line will lead to an
error.</P>
<P>The following example defines the stack size for an application, but allows
the programmer to override the value by specifying <CODE>--define
__STACKSIZE__=xxx</CODE> on the command line.</P>

        SYMBOLS {
            # Define the stack size for the application

<H2><A NAME="ss5.11">5.11</A> <A HREF="ld65.html#toc5.11">Builtin configurations</A>
</H2>


<P>The builtin configurations are part of the linker source. They can be retrieved
with <CODE>--dump-config</CODE> and don't have a special format. So if you need a
special configuration, it's a good idea to start with the builtin configuration
for your system. In a first step, just replace <CODE>-t target</CODE> by <CODE>-C
configfile</CODE>. Then go on and modify the config file to suit your needs.</P>



<H2><A NAME="ss5.12">5.12</A> <A HREF="ld65.html#toc5.12">Secondary configurations</A>
</H2>


<P>Several machine specific binary packages are distributed together with secondary
configurations (in the cfg directory). These configurations can be used with
<CODE>-C configfile</CODE> too.</P>
