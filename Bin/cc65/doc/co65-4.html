<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1</A> <A HREF="co65.html#toc4.1">Differences between static linking and runtime loading</A>
</H2>


<P>One main use of the utility is conversion of loadable drivers, so they may be
linked statically to an application. Statically linking will cause a few
things to be different from runtime loading:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>  Without changing the segment names, all segments take the default
names used by the standard linker configurations. This means that the
driver code is no longer contingous in memory, instead the code
segment is placed somewhere in between all other code segments, the
data segment is placed with all other data segments and so on. If the
driver doesn't do strange things this shouldn't be a problem.
</LI>
<LI>  With statically linked code, data and bss segments will get intialized
once (when the application is loaded), while a loadable driver will
get its initialization each time the driver is loaded into memory
(which may be more than once in the lifetime of a program). It depends
on the driver if this is a problem. Currently, most drivers supplied
with cc65 behave correctly when linked statically.
</LI>
</UL>
</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2</A> <A HREF="co65.html#toc4.2">Additional requirements</A>
</H2>


<P>All loadable drivers used by cc65 have a header and a jump table at the start
of the code segment. The header is needed to detect the driver (it may also
contain some data that is necessary to access the driver). The jump table is
used to access the functions in the driver code.</P>
<P>When loading a driver at runtime, the load address of the driver is also the
address of the code segment, so the locations of the header and jump table are
known. However, when linking the driver statically, it is up to the programmer
to provide this information to the driver API.</P>
<P>For this purpose, it is necessary to define a code segment label that can be
accessed from the outside later. Please note that the converter does currently
<EM>not</EM> create such a label without being ordered to do so, even if the input
file is a cc65 module.</P>
<P>To create such a label, use the <CODE>--code-label</CODE> option when calling the
converter. Be sure to begin the label with a leading underscore when accessing
it from C code. In your code, define an arbitrary variable with this name. Use
the address of this variable as the address of the code segment of the driver.
Be sure to never modify the variable which is in reality the start of your
driver!</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3</A> <A HREF="co65.html#toc4.3">Example - Convert and link a graphics driver</A>
</H2>


<P>As an example, here are some instructions to convert and use the c64-hi.tgi
graphics driver:</P>
<P>First, convert the driver, generating a label named "_c64_hi" for the code
segment. Use the assembler to generate an object file from the assembler
output.</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        co65 --code-label _c64_hi c64-hi.tgi
        ca65 c64-hi.s
  
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Next, change your C code to declare a variable that is actually the first byte
of the driver:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        extern char c64_hi;
  
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Instead of loading and unloading the driver, change the code to install and
uninstall the driver, which will be already in memory after linking:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        /* Install the driver */
        tgi_install (&amp;c64_hi);

        ...

        /* Uninstall the driver */
        tgi_uninstall ();
  
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Don't forget to link the driver object file to your application, otherwise you
will get an "undefined external" error for the _c64_hi symbol.</P>
