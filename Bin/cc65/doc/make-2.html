<P>GNU Make is a both very powerful and very popular make utility. It might even
be called the de facto standard for make utilities. For more information see
the GNU Make home page:</P>

<P>The cc65 development package is available as binaries for several host systems
and can easily built for quite some additional systems. The very same is true
for GNU Make so a cc65-based project coming with a GNU Make Makefile can easily
be built by any cc65 developer no matter what host system is used.</P>
<P>Because of the strong alignment of the cc65 compiler with the ISO C standard it
is very well feasible to compile a single C code base both with the cc65
compiler and other C compilers like for example GCC. GNU Make turns out to be
very well suited to build projects for several target systems using multiple
compilers as it isn't tied to any C compiler.</P>
