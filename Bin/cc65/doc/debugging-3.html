<P>VICE support is mostly done via a label file that is generated by the linker
and that may be read by the VICE monitor, so it knows about your program.
Source level debugging is <CODE>not</CODE> available, you have to debug your programs
in the assembler view.</P>
<P>The first step is to generate object files that contain information about
<EM>all</EM> labels in your sources, not just the exported ones. This can be done
by several means:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Use the -g switch on the assembler command line.
</LI>
<LI>Use the
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
      .debuginfo +
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

command in your source.
</LI>
<LI>Use the <CODE>-g</CODE> switch when invoking the compiler. The compiler will
then place a <CODE>.debuginfo</CODE> command into the generated assembler source.
</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>So, if you have just C code, all you need is to invoke the compiler with
<CODE>-g</CODE>. If you're using assembler code, you have to use <CODE>-g</CODE> for the
assembler, or add "<CODE>.debuginfo on</CODE>" to your source files. Since the
generated debug info is not appended to the generated executables, it is a
good idea to always use <CODE>-g</CODE>. It makes the object files and libraries
slightly larger (~30%), but this is usually not a problem.</P>
<P>The second step is to tell the linker that it should generate a VICE label
file. This is done by the <CODE>-Ln</CODE> switch followed by the name of the label
file (I'm usually using a <CODE>.lbl</CODE> extension for these files). An example for
a linker command line would be:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
    ld65 -t c64 -Ln hello.lbl -m hello.map -o hello crt0 hello.o c64.lib
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>This will generate a file named hello.lbl that contains all symbols used in
your program.</P>
<P><B>Note</B>: The runtime libraries and startup files were generated with
debug info, so you don't have to care about this.</P>
