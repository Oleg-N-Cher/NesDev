<P><EM>Note:</EM> This section applies mostly to C programs, so the explanation
below uses examples from the C libraries. However, the feature may also be
useful for assembler programs.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss16.1">16.1</A> <A HREF="ca65.html#toc16.1">Module constructors/destructors Overview</A>
</H2>


<P>Using the <CODE>
<A HREF="ca65-11.html#.CONSTRUCTOR">.CONSTRUCTOR</A></CODE>, <CODE>
<A HREF="ca65-11.html#.DESTRUCTOR">.DESTRUCTOR</A></CODE> and <CODE>
<A HREF="ca65-11.html#.INTERRUPTOR">.INTERRUPTOR</A></CODE> keywords it it possible to export functions in a
special way. The linker is able to generate tables with all functions of a
specific type. Such a table will <EM>only</EM> include symbols from object
files that are linked into a specific executable. This may be used to add
initialization and cleanup code for library modules, or a table of interrupt
handler functions.</P>
<P>The C heap functions are an example where module initialization code is used.
All heap functions (<CODE>malloc</CODE>, <CODE>free</CODE>, ...) work with a few
variables that contain the start and the end of the heap, pointers to the free
list and so on. Since the end of the heap depends on the size and start of the
stack, it must be initialized at runtime. However, initializing these
variables for programs that do not use the heap are a waste of time and
memory.</P>
<P>So the central module defines a function that contains initialization code and
exports this function using the <CODE>.CONSTRUCTOR</CODE> statement. If (and only if)
this module is added to an executable by the linker, the initialization
function will be placed into the table of constructors by the linker. The C
startup code will call all constructors before <CODE>main</CODE> and all destructors
after <CODE>main</CODE>, so without any further work, the heap initialization code is
called once the module is linked in.</P>
<P>While it would be possible to add explicit calls to initialization functions
in the startup code, the new approach has several advantages:</P>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>If a module is not included, the initialization code is not linked in and not
called. So you don't pay for things you don't need.
</LI>
<LI>Adding another library that needs initialization does not mean that the
startup code has to be changed. Before we had module constructors and
destructors, the startup code for all systems had to be adjusted to call the
new initialization code.
</LI>
<LI>The feature saves memory: Each additional initialization function needs just
two bytes in the table (a pointer to the function).
</LI>
</OL>
</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss16.2">16.2</A> <A HREF="ca65.html#toc16.2">Calling order</A>
</H2>


<P>The symbols are sorted in increasing priority order by the linker when using
one of the builtin linker configurations, so the functions with lower
priorities come first and are followed by those with higher priorities. The C
library runtime subroutine that walks over the function tables calls the
functions starting from the top of the table - which means that functions with
a high priority are called first.</P>
<P>So when using the C runtime, functions are called with high priority functions
first, followed by low priority functions.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss16.3">16.3</A> <A HREF="ca65.html#toc16.3">Pitfalls</A>
</H2>


<P>When using these special symbols, please take care of the following:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The linker will only generate function tables, it will not generate code to
call these functions. If you're using the feature in some other than the
existing C environments, you have to write code to call all functions in a
linker generated table yourself. See the <CODE>condes</CODE> and <CODE>callirq</CODE> modules
in the C runtime for an example on how to do this.
</LI>
<LI>The linker will only add addresses of functions that are in modules linked to
the executable. This means that you have to be careful where to place the
condes functions. If initialization or an irq handler is needed for a group of
functions, be sure to place the function into a module that is linked in
regardless of which function is called by the user.
</LI>
<LI>The linker will generate the tables only when requested to do so by the
<CODE>FEATURE CONDES</CODE> statement in the linker config file. Each table has to
be requested separately.
</LI>
<LI>Constructors and destructors may have priorities. These priorities determine
the order of the functions in the table. If your initialization or cleanup code
does depend on other initialization or cleanup code, you have to choose the
priority for the functions accordingly.
</LI>
<LI>Besides the <CODE>
<A HREF="ca65-11.html#.CONSTRUCTOR">.CONSTRUCTOR</A></CODE>, <CODE>
<A HREF="ca65-11.html#.DESTRUCTOR">.DESTRUCTOR</A></CODE> and <CODE>
<A HREF="ca65-11.html#.INTERRUPTOR">.INTERRUPTOR</A></CODE> statements, there is also a more generic command:
<CODE>
<A HREF="ca65-11.html#.CONDES">.CONDES</A></CODE>. This allows to specify an
additional type. Predefined types are 0 (constructor), 1 (destructor) and 2
(interruptor). The linker generates a separate table for each type on request.
</LI>
</UL>
