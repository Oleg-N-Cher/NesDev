<H2><A NAME="scopes"></A> <A NAME="s7">7.</A> <A HREF="ca65.html#toc7">Scopes</A></H2>


<P>ca65 implements several sorts of scopes for symbols.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.1">7.1</A> <A HREF="ca65.html#toc7.1">Global scope</A>
</H2>


<P>All (non cheap local) symbols that are declared outside of any nested scopes
are in global scope.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss7.2">7.2</A> <A HREF="ca65.html#toc7.2">Cheap locals</A>
</H2>


<P>A special scope is the scope for cheap local symbols. It lasts from one non
local symbol to the next one, without any provisions made by the programmer.
All other scopes differ in usage but use the same concept internally.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss7.3">7.3</A> <A HREF="ca65.html#toc7.3">Generic nested scopes</A>
</H2>


<P>A nested scoped for generic use is started with <CODE>
<A HREF="ca65-11.html#.SCOPE">.SCOPE</A></CODE> and closed with <CODE>
<A HREF="ca65-11.html#.ENDSCOPE">.ENDSCOPE</A></CODE>.
The scope can have a name, in which case it is accessible from the outside by
using 
<A HREF="#scopesyntax">explicit scopes</A>. If the scope does not
have a name, all symbols created within the scope are local to the scope, and
aren't accessible from the outside.</P>
<P>A nested scope can access symbols from the local or from enclosing scopes by
name without using explicit scope names. In some cases there may be
ambiguities, for example if there is a reference to a local symbol that is not
yet defined, but a symbol with the same name exists in outer scopes:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        .scope  outer
                foo     = 2
                .scope  inner
                        lda     #foo
                        foo     = 3
                .endscope
        .endscope
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>In the example above, the <CODE>lda</CODE> instruction will load the value 3 into the
accumulator, because <CODE>foo</CODE> is redefined in the scope. However:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        .scope  outer
                foo     = $1234
                .scope  inner
                        lda     foo,x
                        foo     = $12
                .endscope
        .endscope
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Here, <CODE>lda</CODE> will still load from <CODE>$12,x</CODE>, but since it is unknown to the
assembler that <CODE>foo</CODE> is a zeropage symbol when translating the instruction,
absolute mode is used instead. In fact, the assembler will not use absolute
mode by default, but it will search through the enclosing scopes for a symbol
with the given name. If one is found, the address size of this symbol is used.
This may lead to errors:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        .scope  outer
                foo     = $12
                .scope  inner
                        lda     foo,x
                        foo     = $1234
                .endscope
        .endscope
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>In this case, when the assembler sees the symbol <CODE>foo</CODE> in the <CODE>lda</CODE>
instruction, it will search for an already defined symbol <CODE>foo</CODE>. It will
find <CODE>foo</CODE> in scope <CODE>outer</CODE>, and a close look reveals that it is a
zeropage symbol. So the assembler will use zeropage addressing mode. If
<CODE>foo</CODE> is redefined later in scope <CODE>inner</CODE>, the assembler tries to change
the address in the <CODE>lda</CODE> instruction already translated, but since the new
value needs absolute addressing mode, this fails, and an error message "Range
error" is output.</P>
<P>Of course the most simple solution for the problem is to move the definition
of <CODE>foo</CODE> in scope <CODE>inner</CODE> upwards, so it precedes its use. There may be
rare cases when this cannot be done. In these cases, you can use one of the
address size override operators:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        .scope  outer
                foo     = $12
                .scope  inner
                        lda     a:foo,x
                        foo     = $1234
                .endscope
        .endscope
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>This will cause the <CODE>lda</CODE> instruction to be translated using absolute
addressing mode, which means changing the symbol reference later does not
cause any errors.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss7.4">7.4</A> <A HREF="ca65.html#toc7.4">Nested procedures</A>
</H2>


<P>A nested procedure is created by use of <CODE>
<A HREF="ca65-11.html#.PROC">.PROC</A></CODE>. It
differs from a <CODE>
<A HREF="ca65-11.html#.SCOPE">.SCOPE</A></CODE> in that it must have a
name, and a it will introduce a symbol with this name in the enclosing scope.
So</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        .proc   foo
                ...
        .endproc
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>is actually the same as</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        foo:
        .scope  foo
                ...
        .endscope
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>This is the reason why a procedure must have a name. If you want a scope
without a name, use <CODE>
<A HREF="ca65-11.html#.SCOPE">.SCOPE</A></CODE>.</P>
<P><B>Note:</B> As you can see from the example above, scopes and symbols live in
different namespaces. There can be a symbol named <CODE>foo</CODE> and a scope named
<CODE>foo</CODE> without any conflicts (but see the section titled 
<A HREF="#scopesearch">&#34;Scope search order&#34;</A>).</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss7.5">7.5</A> <A HREF="ca65.html#toc7.5">Structs, unions and enums</A>
</H2>


<P>Structs, unions and enums are explained in a 
<A HREF="ca65-15.html#structs">separate section</A>, I do only cover them here, because if they are declared with a
name, they open a nested scope, similar to <CODE>
<A HREF="ca65-11.html#.SCOPE">.SCOPE</A></CODE>. However, when no name is specified, the behaviour is
different: In this case, no new scope will be opened, symbols declared within
a struct, union, or enum declaration will then be added to the enclosing scope
instead.</P>


<H2><A NAME="scopesyntax"></A> <A NAME="ss7.6">7.6</A> <A HREF="ca65.html#toc7.6">Explicit scope specification</A>
</H2>


<P>Accessing symbols from other scopes is possible by using an explicit scope
specification, provided that the scope where the symbol lives in has a name.
The namespace token (<CODE>::</CODE>) is used to access other scopes:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        .scope  foo
        bar:    .word   0
        .endscope

                ...
                lda     foo::bar        ; Access foo in scope bar
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>The only way to deny access to a scope from the outside is to declare a scope
without a name (using the <CODE>
<A HREF="ca65-11.html#.SCOPE">.SCOPE</A></CODE> command).</P>
<P>A special syntax is used to specify the global scope: If a symbol or scope is
preceded by the namespace token, the global scope is searched:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        bar     = 3

        .scope  foo
                bar     = 2
                lda     #::bar  ; Access the global bar (which is 3)
        .endscope
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>


<H2><A NAME="scopesearch"></A> <A NAME="ss7.7">7.7</A> <A HREF="ca65.html#toc7.7">Scope search order</A>
</H2>


<P>The assembler searches for a scope in a similar way as for a symbol. First, it
looks in the current scope, and then it walks up the enclosing scopes until
the scope is found.</P>
<P>However, one important thing to note when using explicit scope syntax is, that
a symbol may be accessed before it is defined, but a scope may <B>not</B> be
used without a preceding definition. This means that in the following
example:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        .scope  foo
                bar     = 3
        .endscope

        .scope  outer
                lda     #foo::bar  ; Will load 3, not 2!
                .scope  foo
                        bar     = 2
                .endscope
        .endscope
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>the reference to the scope <CODE>foo</CODE> will use the global scope, and not the
local one, because the local one is not visible at the point where it is
referenced.</P>
<P>Things get more complex if a complete chain of scopes is specified:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        .scope  foo
                .scope  outer
                        .scope  inner
                                bar = 1
                        .endscope
                .endscope
                .scope  another
                        .scope  nested
                                lda     #outer::inner::bar      ; 1
                        .endscope
                .endscope
        .endscope

        .scope  outer
                .scope  inner
                        bar = 2
                .endscope
        .endscope
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>When <CODE>outer::inner::bar</CODE> is referenced in the <CODE>lda</CODE> instruction, the
assembler will first search in the local scope for a scope named <CODE>outer</CODE>.
Since none is found, the enclosing scope (<CODE>another</CODE>) is checked. There is
still no scope named <CODE>outer</CODE>, so scope <CODE>foo</CODE> is checked, and finally
scope <CODE>outer</CODE> is found. Within this scope, <CODE>inner</CODE> is searched, and in
this scope, the assembler looks for a symbol named <CODE>bar</CODE>.</P>
<P>Please note that once the anchor scope is found, all following scopes
(<CODE>inner</CODE> in this case) are expected to be found exactly in this scope. The
assembler will search the scope tree only for the first scope (if it is not
anchored in the root scope). Starting from there on, there is no flexibility,
so if the scope named <CODE>outer</CODE> found by the assembler does not contain a
scope named <CODE>inner</CODE>, this would be an error, even if such a pair does exist
(one level up in global scope).</P>
<P>Ambiguities that may be introduced by this search algorithm may be removed by
anchoring the scope specification in the global scope. In the example above,
if you want to access the "other" symbol <CODE>bar</CODE>, you would have to write:</P>
