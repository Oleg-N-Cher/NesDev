<P>Load your program, then enter the monitor and use the "<CODE>ll</CODE>" command to
load your label file like this:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        ll "hello.lbl"
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>You will get lots of warnings and even a few errors. You may ignore safely all
these warnings and errors as long as they reference any problems VICE thinks
it has with the labels.</P>
<P>After loading the labels, they are used by VICE in the disassembler listing,
and you may use them whereever you need to specify an address. Try</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        d ._main
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>as an example (note that VICE needs a leading dot before all labels, and that
the compiler prepends an underline under most named labels).</P>
