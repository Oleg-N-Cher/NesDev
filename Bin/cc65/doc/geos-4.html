<H2><A NAME="s4">4.</A> <A HREF="geos.html#toc4">Library Structures</A></H2>

<P>To simplify usage and optimize passing parameters to functions I have declared several structures
which describe most common objects. Some of these structures are bound to static addresses in
GEOS data space (<CODE>$8000-$8fff</CODE>), so you can use their fields directly in optimized way.
Please see <CODE>gsym.h</CODE> and find them. All structures are defined in <CODE>gstruct.h</CODE> and you may
find also some comments there.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1</A> <A HREF="geos.html#toc4.1">Graphics Structures</A>
</H2>

<H3>pixel</H3>

<P>One simple structure describing a point on the screen.</P>

<H3>fontdesc</H3>

<P>This structure describes a font in one pointsize. There is current font - <CODE>struct fontdesc</CODE>
bound to <CODE>curFontDesc</CODE>. You can also force GEOS to use your own fonts by calling
<CODE>LoadCharSet</CODE>. You just need to open a VLIR font file and load one record - one pointsize -
somewhere. At the start of this area you already have all data for <CODE>fontdesc</CODE> so you can
pass a pointer to the load address of that pointsize to <CODE>LoadCharSet</CODE>. (Note that although
it has 'Load' in the name, that function loads only GEOS internal data structures, not data
from disk).</P>

<H3>window</H3>

<P>This widely used structure holds description of a region of the screen. It describes top-left and
bottom-right corners of a window.</P>

<H3>iconpic</H3>

<P>Maybe the name isn't the best - it has nothing with <CODE>DoIcons</CODE> but with bitmap functions -
<CODE>BitmapUp</CODE> for example. This structure holds parameters needed to properly decode and show
a bitmap on the screen. Bitmap has to be encoded - if you have some non-GEOS bitmaps simply
convert them to Photo Scraps - this is the format used by all GEOS bitmap functions - <CODE>DoIcons</CODE>
too.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2</A> <A HREF="geos.html#toc4.2">Icons</A>
</H2>

<P>These structures describe click boxes (icons) that can be placed on screen or in a dialog box.</P>

<H3>icondef</H3>

<P>This is the definition of a single click box. Please see <CODE>gstruct.h</CODE> for description of its fields.</P>

<H3>icontab</H3>

<P>This is toplevel description of icons to be placed and enabled on the screen. This structure
has following fields:
<UL>
<LI><CODE>char number</CODE> - total number of icons declared here</LI>
<LI><CODE>struct pixel mousepos</CODE> - after finishing <CODE>DoIcons</CODE> mouse pointer will be placed in
this point allowing you to have hint for user what is default action</LI>
<LI><CODE>struct icondef tab[]</CODE> - this table of size equal to <CODE>icontab.number</CODE> contains
descriptions for all icons</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3</A> <A HREF="geos.html#toc4.3">File and Disk</A>
</H2>

<H3>tr_se</H3>

<P>This simple structure holds track and sector number of something. Do not expect the track to be
in range 1-35, as GEOS can support many various and weird devices. For example my C128 256K
expansion is utilized as RAMDisk with layout of 4 tracks 128 sectors each. However assuming that
track number equal to 0 is illegal might be wise.</P>

<H3>f_date</H3>

<P>This is placeholder for file datestamp. This structure is also present in <CODE>struct filehandle</CODE>.
GEOS is not Y2K compliant, so if current file has in <CODE>filehandle.date.year</CODE> value less than 86
you can safely assume that it is e.g. 2004 and not 1904.</P>

<H3>filehandle</H3>

<P>This is main file descriptor. It is either entry in the directory (returned from file functions)
or its copy in <CODE>dirEntryBuf</CODE>. This is optimized so you can safely get to the file's year e.g.
by testing <CODE>dirEntryBuf.date.year</CODE> - it will be compiled to simple <CODE>LDA, STA</CODE>.</P>

<H3>fileheader</H3>

<P>This structure holds fileheader description. You can load file's header into <CODE>fileHeader</CODE>
fixed area using <CODE>GetFHdrInfo</CODE>. (note that <CODE>fileHeader</CODE> is a place in memory while
<CODE>fileheader</CODE> is a structure).
You will also need own fileheader for <CODE>SaveFile</CODE>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.4">4.4</A> <A HREF="geos.html#toc4.4">System Structures</A>
</H2>

<H3>s_date</H3>

<P>This structure is defined only for <CODE>system_date</CODE>. It is slightly different from <CODE>f_date</CODE>
so I prepared this one. You can e.g. get or set current time using <CODE>system_date.s_hour</CODE> and
<CODE>system_date.s_minute</CODE>. Accesses to these will be optimized to simple <CODE>LDA</CODE> and <CODE>STA</CODE>
pair.</P>

<H3>process</H3>

<P>You should declare a table of that type to prepare data for <CODE>InitProcesses</CODE>. The maximum number
of processes is 20, and the last entry has to be equal to <CODE>{NULL,NULL}</CODE>, so this table may hold
only 21 entries. The first member of this structure (<CODE>pointer</CODE>) holds the pointer to called
function (void returning void), you will probably have to cast that pointer into <CODE>unsigned int</CODE>.
The second field <CODE>jiffies</CODE> holds the amount of time between calls to that function.
On PAL systems there are 50 jiffies per second, while NTSC have 60 of them.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.5">4.5</A> <A HREF="geos.html#toc4.5">Few thing in detail...</A>
</H2>

<P>GEOSLib uses cc65 non-ANSI extensions to easily initialize data in memory. This is done with a
kind of array of unspecified length and unspecified type. Here is how it goes:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
void example = {
    (char)3, (unsigned)3, (char)0 };
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Which will be compiled to following string of bytes:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
_example:
        .byte 3
        .word 3
        .byte 0
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

As you see this way it is possible to define data of any type in any order. You must remember to
cast each member to proper type.</P>

<H3>DoMenu structure</H3>

<P><CODE>DoMenu</CODE> is responsible for everything concerned with menu processing. Many, many GEOS programs
are just initializing screen and menu and exit to <CODE>MainLoop</CODE>. In GEOSLib it is the same as
returning from <CODE>main</CODE> function without using <CODE>exit(0)</CODE>.</P>
<P>Menu is described by two types of data - menu descriptors and menu items. Descriptor contains
information about following menu items, and items are containing names of entries and either
pointers to functions to execute or, in case of nested menus, pointers to submenu descriptors.
Note that submenu descriptor can be top-level descriptor, there's no difference in structure,
just in the content.</P>
<P>Here is how single descriptor looks like:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
void myMenu = {
        (char)top, (char)bottom,                // this is the size of the menubox
        (unsigned)left, (unsigned)right,        // counting all items in current descriptor
        (char)number_of_items | type_of_menu,   // number of following items ORed with
                                                // type of this menu, it can be either
        // HORIZONTAL or VERTICAL if you will have also bit 6 set then menu won't be closed
        // after moving mouse pointer outside the menubox. You can have at most 31 items.
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

This is followed by <CODE>number_of_items</CODE> of following item description.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        ...
        "menuitemname", (char)item_type, (unsigned)pointer,
        "nextitemname", (char)item_type, (unsigned)pointer,
        ...
        "lastitemname", (char)item_type, (unsigned)pointer };
        // Note that there isn't ending &lt;tt/NULL/ or something like that.
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<CODE>pointer</CODE> is a pointer to something, what it points for depends from <CODE>item_type</CODE>. This one
can have following values:</P>
<P><CODE>MENU_ACTION</CODE> - a function pointed by <CODE>pointer</CODE> will be called after clicking on menu item</P>
<P><CODE>SUB_MENU</CODE> - <CODE>pointer</CODE> points to next menu descriptor - a submenu</P>
<P>Both of them can be ORed with <CODE>DYN_SUB_MENU</CODE> and then the <CODE>pointer</CODE> points to a function
which will return in <CODE>r0</CODE> needed pointer (to function to execute or a submenu).</P>
<P>For creating nested menus (you can have at most 8 levels of submenus) you need to declare such
structure for each submenu and top level menu.</P>

<H3>DoDlgBox command string</H3>

<P><CODE>DoDlgBox</CODE> is together with <CODE>DoMenu</CODE> one of the most powerful routines in GEOS. It is
responsible for creating dialog boxes, that is windows which task is to interact with user.
Format of the command string is following:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
    (window size and position)
    (commands and parameters)
    NULL
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

There is custom type defined for the command string: <CODE>dlgBoxStr</CODE>.</P>

<H3>Size and position</H3>

<P>The first element can be specified in two ways - by using default size and position or specifying
own. The first case results in
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
const dlgBoxStr example = {
        DB_DEFPOS (pattern_of_shadow),
        ...             // commands
        DB_END };
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

And the own size and position would be:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
const dlgBoxStr example = {
        DB_SETPOS (pattern, top, bottom, left, right)
        ...             // commands
        DB_END };
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<H3>Commands</H3>

<P>The next element of <CODE>DoDlgBox</CODE> command string are commands themselves. First six commands are
default icons and the number of selected icon will be returned from window processor. The icons are
<CODE>OK, CANCEL, YES, NO, OPEN</CODE>, and <CODE>DISK</CODE>. You can use predefined macros for use them, e.g.:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        ...
        DB_ICON(OK, DBI_X_0, DBI_Y_0),
        ...
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Note that the position is counted from top left corner of window, not entire screen and that the 'x'
position is counted in cards (8-pixel) and not in pixels. This is true also for all following commands.
<CODE>DBI_X_0</CODE> and <CODE>DBI_Y_0</CODE> are predefined (see <CODE>gdlgbox.h</CODE> for more), default positions
which will make icons to appear on default window exactly where you would expect them.</P>
<P><CODE>DB_TXTSTR (x, y, text)</CODE> will cause to show given text in the window.</P>
<P><CODE>DB_VARSTR (x, y, ptr)</CODE> works as above, but here you are passing a pointer to a zero page location
where the address of text is stored. This is useful for information windows where only text content
is variable. Consider following:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
char text = "foo";
        ...
        r15=(unsigned)text;             // in code just before call to DoDlgBox
        ...
        DB_VARSTR (TXT_LN_X, TXT_LN_1_Y, &amp;r15),
        ...
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

will cause to appear the word ``foo'' in the window, but you may store the pointer to any text in
<CODE>r15</CODE> (in this case) before call to DoDlgBox.</P>
<P><CODE>DB_GETSTR(x, y, ptr, length)</CODE> - will add input from keyboard feature. <CODE>ptr</CODE> works as in
previous example and points to place where text is to be stored. Note that the contents of this
place will be shown upon creating window. <CODE>length</CODE> is the maximum number of characters to input.</P>
<P><CODE>DB_SYSOPV(ptr)</CODE> - this sets <CODE>otherPressVec</CODE> to given pointer. It is called on every keypress.</P>
<P><CODE>DB_GRPHSTR(ptr)</CODE> - data for this command is the pointer for <CODE>GraphicsString</CODE> commands.</P>
<P><CODE>DB_GETFILES(x, y)</CODE> - for standard window you should pass 4 for both x and y. This function
draws file selection box and searches current drive for files. Before call to <CODE>DoDlgBox</CODE> you
must load <CODE>r7L</CODE> with GEOS filetype of searched files and <CODE>r10</CODE> with class text. In <CODE>r5</CODE>
you have to load pointer to a <CODE>char[17]</CODE> where selected filename will be copied. It works
like <CODE>FindFTypes</CODE> but is limited to first 16 files.</P>
<P><CODE>DB_OPVEC(ptr)</CODE> - this sets the new pointer for button press function, if you pass
<CODE>RstrFrmDialogue</CODE> here you will cause the window to close after pressing mouse button.</P>
<P><CODE>DB_USRICON(x, y, ptr)</CODE> - places single user icon (click box) on window, <CODE>ptr</CODE> points at a
<CODE>struct icondef</CODE> but fields <CODE>x</CODE> and <CODE>y</CODE> are not used here. You can have at most 8 click
boxes in a window, this is internal limit of GEOS Kernal.</P>
<P><CODE>DB_USRROUT(ptr)</CODE> - this command causes to immediately call user routine pointed by <CODE>ptr</CODE>.</P>

<H3>GraphicsString command string</H3>

<P><CODE>GraphicsString</CODE> is a very powerful routine to initialize whole screen at once. There are
predefined macros for all commands, names are self-explanatory, see them in <CODE>ggraph.h</CODE>. Last
command have to be <CODE>GSTR_END</CODE>. There is custom type defined for the command string: <CODE>graphicStr</CODE>.</P>
<P>Here is an example for clearing the screen:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
const graphicStr example = {
        MOVEPENTO(0,0),
        NEWPATTERN(0),
        RECTANGLETO(319,199)
        GSTR_END };
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<H3>InitRam table</H3>

<P>This type of data is used to initialize one or more bytes in many places at once. The format is
as following:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
void example = {
    (unsigned)address_to_store_values_at,
    (char)number_of_bytes_that_follow,
    (char)data,(char)data (...)
    // more such definitions
    (unsigned)NULL // address of 0 ends the table
    };
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<H3>Intercepting system vectors</H3>

<P>It is possible to intercept and hook in the GEOS Kernal using vectors. Here is a little example:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
void_func oldVector;

void NewVectorHandler(void) {
        // do something and at the end call the old vector routine
        oldVector();
}

void hook_into_system(void) {
        oldVector = mouseVector;
        mouseVector = NewVectorHandler;
}

void remove_hook(void) {
        mouseVector = oldVector;
}
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>In your <CODE>main</CODE> function you should call <CODE>hook_into_system()</CODE> but <EM>after</EM> all calls to GEOS
kernal (like <CODE>DoMenu</CODE>, <CODE>DoIcons</CODE>, etc.) - right before passing control to the <CODE>MainLoop()</CODE>.
Be warned that vectors are most likely to be changed by GEOS kernal also by other functions (like
<CODE>GotoFirstMenu</CODE>, <CODE>DoDlgBox</CODE> and its derivatives etc.). It depends on what kernal functions
you use and which vectors you altered. Unfortunately there is no exact list for GEOS 2.0, a complete
list for GEOS 1.x can be found in A. Boyce's Programmers' Reference Guide mentioned before. Most of
information contained there should be still valid for GEOS 2.0. When calling a function that restores
the vector you should add a <CODE>hook_into_system()</CODE> call right after it.</P>
<P>It is critical to restore old vector values before exiting the program. If you have more than one
place where you call <CODE>exit()</CODE> then it might be worth to register <CODE>remove_hook</CODE> function to
be called upon exiting with <CODE>atexit(&amp;remove_hook);</CODE> call. This way you will ensure that
such destructor will be always called.</P>
<P>That little example above intercepts <CODE>mouseVector</CODE>. The <CODE>NewVectorHandler</CODE> function will be
called every time the mouse button changes status. Other important vectors you should know about
are:
<UL>
<LI><CODE>appMain</CODE> - this is called from within <CODE>MainLoop</CODE> system loop</LI>
<LI><CODE>keyVector</CODE> - called whenever a keypress occurs</LI>
<LI><CODE>intTopVector</CODE> - called at the start of IRQ routine</LI>
<LI><CODE>intBotVector</CODE> - called at the end of IRQ routine</LI>
</UL>
</P>
