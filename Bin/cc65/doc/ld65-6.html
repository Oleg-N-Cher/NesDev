<P>The builtin config files do contain segments that have a special meaning for
the compiler and the libraries that come with it. If you replace the builtin
config files, you will need the following information.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.1">6.1</A> <A HREF="ld65.html#toc6.1">INIT</A>
</H2>


<P>The INIT segment is used for initialization code that may be reused once
execution reaches main() - provided that the program runs in RAM. You
may for example add the INIT segment to the heap in really memory
constrained systems.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.2">6.2</A> <A HREF="ld65.html#toc6.2">LOWCODE</A>
</H2>


<P>For the LOWCODE segment, it is guaranteed that it won't be banked out, so it
is reachable at any time by interrupt handlers or similar.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.3">6.3</A> <A HREF="ld65.html#toc6.3">STARTUP</A>
</H2>


<P>This segment contains the startup code which initializes the C software stack
and the libraries. It is placed in its own segment because it needs to be
loaded at the lowest possible program address on several platforms.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.4">6.4</A> <A HREF="ld65.html#toc6.4">ZPSAVE</A>
</H2>


<P>The ZPSAVE segment contains the original values of the zeropage locations used
by the ZEROPAGE segment. It is placed in its own segment because it must not be
initialized.</P>
