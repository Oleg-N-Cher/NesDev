<P>ProDOS 8 system programs are always loaded to the start address $2000.
For cc65 programs this means that the 6 KB from $800 to $2000 are
by default unused. There are however several options to make use of that memory
range.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1</A> <A HREF="apple2enh.html#toc5.1">LOADER.SYSTEM</A>
</H2>


<P>The easiest (and for really large programs in fact the only) way to have a cc65
program use the memory from $800 to $2000 is to link it as binary
(as opposed to system) program using the linker configuration
<A HREF="apple2enh-4.html#ss4.4">apple2enh-loader.cfg</A> with start address
$800 and load it with <B>LOADER.SYSTEM - an Apple&nbsp;][
ProDOS 8 loader for cc65 programs</B>. The program then works like a system program
(i.e. quits to the ProDOS dispatcher).</P>
<P>Using LOADER.SYSTEM is as simple as copying it to the ProDOS 8 directory of the
program to load under name &lt;program&gt;.SYSTEM as a system program. For
example the program <CODE>MYPROG</CODE> is loaded by <CODE>MYPROG.SYSTEM</CODE>.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2</A> <A HREF="apple2enh.html#toc5.2">Heap</A>
</H2>


<P>If the cc65 program can be successully linked as system program using the linker
configuration 
<A HREF="apple2enh-4.html#ss4.3">apple2enh-system.cfg</A> but
uses the heap either explicitly or implicitly (i.e. by loading a driver) then
the memory from $800 to $2000 can be added to the heap by calling
<CODE>_heapadd ((void *) 0x0800, 0x1800);</CODE> at the beginning of <CODE>main()</CODE>.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3</A> <A HREF="apple2enh.html#toc5.3">ProDOS 8 I/O buffers</A>
</H2>


<P>ProDOS 8 requires for every open file a page-aligned 1 KB I/O buffer. By default
these buffers are allocated by the cc65 runtime system on the heap using
<CODE>posix_memalign()</CODE>. While this is generally the best solution it means quite
some overhead for (especially rather small) cc65 programs which do open files
but don't make use of the heap otherwise.</P>
<P>The apple2enh package comes with the alternative ProDOS 8 I/O buffer allocation
module <CODE>apple2enh-iobuf-0800.o</CODE> which uses the memory between $800 and
the program start address for the 1 KB I/O buffers. For system programs (with
start address $2000) this results in up to 6 I/O buffers and thus up to 6
concurrently open files.</P>
<P>While using <CODE>_heapadd()</CODE> as described in the section above together with the
default I/O buffer allocation basically yields the same placement of I/O buffers
in memory the primary benefit of <CODE>apple2enh-iobuf-0800.o</CODE> is a reduction in code
size - and thus program file size - of more than 1400 bytes.</P>
<P>Using <CODE>apple2enh-iobuf-0800.o</CODE> is as simple as placing it on the linker command 
line like this:</P>
