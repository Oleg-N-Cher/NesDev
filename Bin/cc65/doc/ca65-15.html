<H2><A NAME="ss15.1">15.1</A> <A HREF="ca65.html#toc15.1">Structs and unions Overview</A>
</H2>


<P>Structs and unions are special forms of 
<A HREF="ca65-7.html#scopes">scopes</A>.  They
are to some degree comparable to their C counterparts. Both have a list of
members. Each member allocates storage and may optionally have a name, which,
in case of a struct, is the offset from the beginning and, in case of a union,
is always zero.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss15.2">15.2</A> <A HREF="ca65.html#toc15.2">Declaration</A>
</H2>


<P>Here is an example for a very simple struct with two members and a total size
of 4 bytes:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
      .struct Point
              xcoord  .word
              ycoord  .word
      .endstruct
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>A union shares the total space between all its members, its size is the same
as that of the largest member.</P>
<P>A struct or union must not necessarily have a name. If it is anonymous, no
local scope is opened, the identifiers used to name the members are placed
into the current scope instead.</P>
<P>A struct may contain unnamed members and definitions of local structs. The
storage allocators may contain a multiplier, as in the example below:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
      .struct Circle
              .struct Point
                      .word   2         ; Allocate two words
              .endstruct
              Radius  .word
      .endstruct
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss15.3">15.3</A> <A HREF="ca65.html#toc15.3">The <CODE>.TAG</CODE> keyword</A>
</H2>


<P>Using the 
<A HREF="ca65-11.html#.TAG">.TAG</A> keyword, it is possible to reserve space
for an already defined struct or unions within another struct:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
      .struct Point
              xcoord  .word
              ycoord  .word
      .endstruct

      .struct Circle
              Origin  .tag    Point
              Radius  .byte
      .endstruct
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Space for a struct or union may be allocated using the 
<A HREF="ca65-11.html#.TAG">.TAG</A> directive.</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        C:      .tag    Circle
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Currently, members are just offsets from the start of the struct or union. To
access a field of a struct, the member offset has to be added to the address
of the struct itself:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        lda     C+Circle::Radius        ; Load circle radius into A
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>This may change in a future version of the assembler.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss15.4">15.4</A> <A HREF="ca65.html#toc15.4">Limitations</A>
</H2>


<P>Structs and unions are currently implemented as nested symbol tables (in fact,
they were a by-product of the improved scoping rules). Currently, the
assembler has no idea of types. This means that the 
<A HREF="ca65-11.html#.TAG">.TAG</A> keyword will only allocate space. You won't be able to initialize
variables declared with 
<A HREF="ca65-11.html#.TAG">.TAG</A>, and adding an embedded
structure to another structure with 
<A HREF="ca65-11.html#.TAG">.TAG</A> will not make
this structure accessible by using the '::' operator.</P>
